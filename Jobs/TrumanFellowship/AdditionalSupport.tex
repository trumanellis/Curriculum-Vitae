% The research proposal may request additional support for research and research-related activities. 
% Requests may include: lab materials and supplies; conference/symposia support (includes travel, 
% per diem and conference fees); professional society membership fee(s); and other support 
% appropriate for the field of research. Identify new equipment required to conduct your research 
% and/or your need to use Sandiaâ€™s existing equipment. All supplemental requests must be justified in 
% the proposal. Items necessary and reasonable to conduct the proposed research will be provided 
% (office space, computer, etc.) and need not be included in the additional support request
Since the aim of my research will be to develop algorithms for high performance computing systems, 
I will be going through many compute hours. 
It is difficult to estimate now just how many I will need, but that is something I can discuss with other HPC researchers at Sandia.
I would prefer to attend at least two conferences per year to exchange ideas with other researchers in this field.
I would also like to maintain professional memberships in SIAM and ACM.
