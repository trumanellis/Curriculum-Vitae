\noindent
I am a fifth year Ph.D student in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin.
Pavel Bochev recommended I apply to the von Neumann Fellowship as an ideal way to begin a research career at Sandia.
I already have a good deal of experience with the DOE labs through several summers working with 
Tzanio Kolev and Rob Rieben at LLNL on my Master's thesis 
and I feel like I would be right at home working on the unique scientific challenges that Sandia faces.
% and I think that the unique scientific challenges that Sandia faces would be a very rewarding target for me to work on.
I'm especially excited by the prospect of doing research that is so vital to the future energy and security demands of our nation.
% I'm especially attracted by the idea of being part of a team that in some way addresses the future energy demands of our nation.
% and I think the problems that Sandia works on would present a very challenging and rewarding target for my research.

My Ph.D. research on stabilized finite element methods for multi-physics applications has led me to develop a 
set of skills and domain of knowledge that I believe could be best put to use at one of the national labs.
In particular, I believe that the research I am conducting for my dissertation, given further development,
could be a valuable asset for the types of simulations prevalent in energy research, particularly the high energy density physics simulations
at the core of NNSA's stockpile stewardship mission.

% Dr. Ridzal,

% I am a fifth year Ph.D student in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin.
% Pavel Bochev recommended I apply to the von Neumann Fellowship as a great way to begin a research career at Sandia.
% I already have a good deal of experience with the DOE lab research culture through several summers working with 
% Tzanio Kolev and Rob Rieben at LLNL on my Master's thesis.

% My Ph.D. research on stabilized finite element methods for multi-physics applications has led me to develop a 
% set of skills and domain of knowledge that I believe could be best put to use at one of the national labs.
% In particular, I believe that the research I am conducting for my dissertation, given further development,
% could be a valuable asset for the types of simulations prevalent in energy research.
% Exposure to Trilinos - impressed with Sandia's forward thinking development environment.

% % I'm interested in applying to the von Neumann Fellowship and excited by the prospect of a research career at Sandia.
% % I'm especially excited at the prospect of applying my background in computational science to matters of national importance 
% % related to solving our nation's future energy demands.

% % I already have extensive experience working in a DOE lab environment and am familiar with many of the technologies in use, 
% % having written my Master's thesis on high order Lagrangian hydrocodes developed for high energy density physics applications
% % under the supervision of scientists at Lawrence Livermore.
% % Since then, my Ph.D. experience has trained me in the intricacies of multi-physics simulations and stabilized finite element methods.

% % I am particularly excited by the research culture at Sandia. 

% % My doctoral research has introduced me to the very fascinating field of stabilized finite element methods.
% % In particular, my time in graduate school coincided with the introduction of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method 
% % (work for which my advisor, Leszek Demkowicz recently received the IACM Computational Mechanics Award)
% % and I have been privileged to witness DPG grow from early 1D convection-diffusion results to 
% % full Navier-Stokes solutions and a host of other challenging problems.
% % My work has been devoted to perfecting DPG for fluid dynamics applications, starting with a locally conservative variant and 
% % converging on space-time formulations for transient flows.
% % Beginning with the heat equation, I developed a theory and a framework for how space-time DPG should work and then quickly extended this to compressible
% % Navier-Stokes and obtained some very promising results on shock tube problems.
% % The rest of my dissertation (still in progress) will result in 2D incompressible and compressible simulations, but
% % even so, I feel as though I will have only scratched the surface when it comes to space-time DPG.
% % Our preliminary results have generated a lot of excitement at national and international conferences,
% % and we are convinced that this technique has a lot of potential for exploiting the features of future high performance computing systems.
% % I am coauthor on two papers which came out of my internships at Lawrence Livermore developing modern Lagrangian compressible flow solvers.
% % In addition to a couple of technical reports, my first paper as lead author was just published on the topic of locally conservative DPG 
% % and a second on space-time DPG was just submitted to Computers \& Fluids.
% % A third mathematically oriented paper on the robustness of space-time DPG is current in preparation,
% % as well as a comparison of simulations utilizing primitive, conservation, and entropy variables.
% % % and a fourth paper on our 2D results will probably be submitted before next spring.

% % Unfortunately, due to the developmental nature of my dissertation work, I won't have the opportunity to do more than a few standard test problems.
% % Being a very application-oriented person, I would relish the opportunity to work on some more challenging simulations.
% % So primarily I am excited about the von Neumann Fellowship as a means to advance research which I believe to have a bright future for computational mechanics.
% % I have past experience working at Lawrence Livermore (four summers) and admire the research culture created at the DOE labs. 
% % The lab environment aligns closely with my ideal combination of private industry and academia 
% % and I am excited by the possibility of conducting this research at Sandia.
% % I appreciate your time in consideration of my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.
